# **CaptionBot** 😎✨

Image Captioning is the process of generating textual description of an image. 🏞

It uses both ***Natural Language Processing*** 📃 and ***Computer Vision*** 📽 to generate the captions.

Here , 

- The dataset I have used is : *Flickr8K* dataset.

- *ResNet50*  (pre-trained model) is used  to interpret the content of the photos.

- *LSTM* is used for the textual data.
